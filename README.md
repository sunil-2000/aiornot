# Code for AI or Not Competition.
Model training and evaluation code for [Hugging Face AI or Not Competition](https://huggingface.co/spaces/competitions/aiornot). Primary objective is to achieve minimal cross entropy loss for binary image classiciation task of determining whether an image is AI generated or not. All model finetuning is performed on a single GPU through Colab. The competition dataset is used to finetune VIT-base, VIT-large, and Facebook's VIT mae (large and base) transformers. Best log loss achieved: $0.0739$ with ~97% accuracy, placing 35/98 entries.
